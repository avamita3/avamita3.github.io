    <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
    <p> Graphic Design and Multimedia is part of the Electronic Media area and focuses on educating and encouraging emerging artists, <a href="index 3.html">designers</a>, and video artists by providing undergraduate and graduate-level education that develops self-discipline, motivation, expertise, and individuality in its students. Simultaneously, the student's artistic sensibilities and knowledge of the humanities are enriched at the University.
<br>
<br>
    Graphic Design is a leadership profession serving mass media communication and corporations. Multimedia art is a profession that services the internet, the film/video industry, exhibiting galleries and mass media publishing. It encompasses web design, video art and installation for exhibition.

    Graduates of the Graphic Design program work as designers and creative directors. Multimedia Artists produce video art for gallery exhibits, design for the web, and produce interactive CD ROMs. In their senior year, students are encouraged to seek internships in the Miami/Broward area.</p>
