    <h1>My Designs</h1>
    <img id="img3" src="images/Cheetah.png" alt="" width="41%">
<p>I started to really enjoy graphic design when I was a senior in high school. I had the opportunity to take a graphic design class and immediately knew that graphic design was what I wanted to major in. Throughout my time at the University of Miami I have been able to take great classes that have helped me step out of my comfort zone and learn to be a better graphic designer.</p>
